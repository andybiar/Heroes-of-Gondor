This brush set is © midnightstouch      http://midnightstouch.deviantart.com/

Please respect the time and effort that I put into making these brushes.

They are free for personal use

To members of Deviant Art :  I do grant permission for use in DA Prints. I simply ask that that I be given credit with a link back to my DA page, and that I be notified of their use so that I can check out your creation, fav and add it to my wish list. Off-site use is generally not a problem with me, but I do like to be asked and again, credited with a link back to my DA page.

Commercial use : You DO require my permission, but I'm generally very accomodating

To all users : You may share them, but you must include this READ ME along with the the brushes.  You may NOT alter them, package them with other brushes and/or redistribute them as your own.
